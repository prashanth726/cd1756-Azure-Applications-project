For this project i have gone with Azure App service since the deployment proess is easier

Cost Comparision:

App Service - P1v3 plan is a DsV2 Azure VM 2 Core, 8 GB RAM, 250 GB Storage. Costs $275.21 USD per month.
Azure VMs - DsV5 Series Azure VM 2 Cores, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB Standard SSD Storage. Costs $182.92 USD per month.

If we go with the VM the deployment might have been the difficult, the APP service making the process easier with CI/CD integration.
